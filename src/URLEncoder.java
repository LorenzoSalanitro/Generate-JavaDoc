/**
 * Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods for converting a String to the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME format. For more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML specification.
 * <br>
 * When encoding a String, the following rules apply:
 * 
 * <li>
 *      <ul>The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain the same.</ul>
 *      <ul>The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.</ul>
 *      <ul>The space character " " is converted into a plus sign "+".</ul>
 *      <ul>All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string "%xy", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used.</ul>
 * </li>
 * <br>
 * For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string "The string ü@foo-bar" would get converted to "The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar" because in UTF-8 the character ü is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).
